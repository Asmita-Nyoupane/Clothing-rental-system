Our platform prioritizes security and user control, beginning with a robust login and sign-up system to authenticate users and prevent unauthorized access. Once logged in, users can seamlessly navigate to a clear and intuitive lending form, where they can effortlessly post details about clothing items, specifying essential fields such as description, size, and rental terms. To maintain integrity, only authorized users are granted the ability to edit, delete, and manage their own posts, ensuring a secure environment. Additionally, we've integrated a geospatial algorithm, allowing users to easily search for nearby clothing items, enhancing accessibility and convenience. Furthermore, we promote user engagement by enabling comments on posts, with users having the option to view and delete their own contributions. To facilitate direct communication between renters and lenders, we've developed a real-time chat system, fostering seamless interaction and improving the overall user experience.
